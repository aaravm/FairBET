# BASICALLY WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WE ARE INITIATING A PLAYER CLIENT IN THE DEVNET 
# Then we push the Player's system credentials and wallet address in a .env file,
# Then these credentials are extracted by the game_manager in its client code and then 
# these credentials are computed blindly in the network and the final 
# UNIFIED_SYSTEM_IDENTIFIER FOR HARDWARE BAN is computed in the network 
# and stored under the ownership of the game_manager

# now he can see if that UNIFIED_SYSTEM_IDENTIFIER FOR HARDWARE BAN is BANNED OR NOT, 
# and hence HARWARE_BANNING could be implemented
